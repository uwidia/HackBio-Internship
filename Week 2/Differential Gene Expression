Involved in several processes, including positive regulation of angiogenesis; positive regulation of defense response to bacterium; and positive regulation of platelet aggregation. Located in extracellular region.", "PI16": "Predicted to enable peptidase inhibitor activity. Predicted to be involved in negative regulation of peptidase activity. Predicted to act upstream of or within negative regulation of cell growth involved in cardiac muscle cell development. Predicted to be located in extracellular region. Predicted to be active in extracellular space.", "C4orf45": "SPMIP2 (formerly C4orf45) (Sperm Microtubule Inner Protein 2) is a Protein Coding gene.
